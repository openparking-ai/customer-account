"""G2 -- docs/CONTRACT.md is generated, and generation is not verification.

`scripts/generate_contract.py --check` proves the document matches its
generator. It cannot prove the generator DERIVES anything: a template whose
prose is fixed everywhere except the holes agrees with itself perfectly. So
each test here plants a value that contradicts a published sentence and
requires the rendered sentence to CHANGE. A sentence that survives its plant
is a fixed string, and this file is where that would be found out.

Every plant runs the generator in a fresh interpreter (`rendered` below), so
the module-level registries it imports are re-read from the planted files
rather than served from this process's cache.
